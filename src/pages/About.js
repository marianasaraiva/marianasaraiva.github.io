      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm shy and talk a lot, it seems contradictory but it's exactly like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        With these characteristics I worked for years in the hospital area, learning to have resilience, a sense of urgency and to work as a team.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it was when I needed to transform the paper records to the system that I found myself in love with Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The teenager who had taken the entrance exam for computational mathematics came along and took care of me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today I am a student of Web Development at Trybe.
